## 📚 Theory

### 📌 What are 2D Arrays?

A **2D array** is a grid-like data structure where elements are stored in **rows and columns**. It is essentially an array of arrays, making it ideal for:

- Matrix representation
- Tabular data
- Grids in simulations or games

#### 🔍 Key Characteristics:
- Fixed dimensions defined at compile time  
- Accessed using two indices: `array[row][column]`  
- Suitable for a wide range of operations like matrix math, image processing, and tabular computations

## 🔄 Common Operations

| Operation        | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input/Output     | Use nested loops to read and display matrix elements          |
| Transpose        | Flip rows and columns: `b[i][j] = a[j][i]`                    |
| Addition         | Element-wise addition of two matrices                         |
| Multiplication   | Dot product of rows and columns (standard matrix multiplication) |
| Diagonal Sum     | Sum of elements where `i == j` (main diagonal) and/or `i + j == n - 1` (secondary diagonal) |
| Row Comparison   | Compare two rows to check if all elements are equal           |

## ⚙️ Best Practices & Optimization Tips

✅ Validate matrix dimensions before performing operations  
✅ Use nested loops carefully to avoid index mismatches  
✅ Break down operations into reusable functions for clarity  
✅ Use dynamic memory (`new`/`delete`) or `std::vector` for large or flexible matrices  
✅ Always initialize result matrices to avoid garbage values

## 📋 Algorithms

### ✅ Matrix Transpose
**Algorithm:**
```cpp
Start
Declare matrix a[r][c]
Loop through i and j:
    Assign b[i][j] = a[j][i]
Print transposed matrix
End
