🧮 2D Arrays in C++
**🎯 AIM
To understand and implement two-dimensional arrays in C++, exploring their structure, operations, and applications in matrix manipulation and algorithmic problem-solving.

**📚 THEORY
📌 2D Arrays
A 2D array is a grid-like data structure where elements are stored in rows and columns.
It is essentially an array of arrays, allowing representation of matrices and tabular data.

Fixed dimensions defined at compile time
Accessed using two indices: array[row][column]
Useful for matrix operations, image processing, and tabular computations
**🔄 Common Operations
Operation	Description
Input/Output	Nested loops to read and display matrix elements
Transpose	Flip rows and columns: b[i][j] = a[j][i]
Addition	Element-wise sum of two matrices
Multiplication	Dot product of rows and columns
Diagonal Sum	Sum of elements where i == j (and optionally i + j == n - 1)
Row Comparison	Compare elements of two rows for equality
**⚙️ Best Practices and Optimization Tips
✅ Validate matrix dimensions before performing operations.
✅ Use nested loops carefully to avoid index mismatches.
✅ Prefer modular code — break operations into functions for clarity.
✅ For large matrices, consider dynamic allocation or std::vector.
✅ Always initialize result matrices to avoid garbage values.

**📋 Algorithms
✅ Matrix Transpose
Algorithm:

Start
Declare matrix a[r][c]
Loop through i and j:
Assign b[i][j] = a[j][i]
Print transposed matrix
End
**✅ Matrix Addition
Algorithm:

Start
Input two matrices of same dimensions
Loop through i and j:
Add corresponding elements: sum[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[i][j]
Print result matrix
End
**✅ Matrix Multiplication
Algorithm:

Start
Input matrices A[r1][c1] and B[r2][c2]
Check if c1 == r2
Loop through i, j, and k:
Multiply and accumulate: C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
Print result matrix
End
**✅ Diagonal Sum
Algorithm:

Start
Input square matrix a[n][n]
Loop through i:
Add a[i][i] to sum
Optionally add a[i][n-i-1] for secondary diagonal
Print sum
End
**✅ Row Comparison
Algorithm:

Start
Input matrix a[r][c]
Compare elements of row 1 and row 2
Print whether each element is equal or not
End
**🧠 CONCLUSION
Two-dimensional arrays are essential for representing structured data in C++. Mastering operations like transpose, addition, multiplication, and diagonal analysis builds a strong foundation for solving matrix-based problems. Through careful indexing, validation, and use of nested loops, programmers can manipulate 2D arrays efficiently. These skills are crucial for applications in scientific computing, graphics, and data analysis, forming a bridge to more advanced topics like dynamic memory, STL containers, and algorithm optimization# CPP-Arrays
